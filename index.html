  <p><em>Since ancient times,</em> sharing a meal has been one of humanity's most revered social rituals.<br/> To break bread with someone is <em>to communicate</em> and <em>to connect</em> with them in the most meaningful way.</p>

  <p>Modern technology has <em>connected us</em> in ways we previously thought impossible, but we have yet to truly wed the power of the Internet with the <em>bonding qualities</em> of sharing a meal.</p>

  <p><em>Until now.</em></p>
